# Setup Instructions

## 1. Set up Environment Variables

Ensure that all necessary environment variables are set up properly before running the application. These include configurations for your proxy, Chrome profile, and any other required settings.

## 2. Proxy Authentication and Chrome Setup

The script uses Google Chrome with a **default profile** to scrape data from Twitter. During the browser startup, **proxy authentication** is handled automatically.

## 3. Use Another Browser for Frontend Interaction

While Chrome is used for backend data extraction (Twitter scraping), you should use **any other browser** (such as Firefox, Edge, etc.) for interacting with the frontend of the application. This ensures that the data extraction process runs smoothly without interference.
